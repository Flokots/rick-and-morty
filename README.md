A web app for displaying character profiles from the show Rick and Morty.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## Author

## Demo 
[Rick and Mory](https://flokots.github.io/rick-and-morty/)

### Task
1. Create a Single Page App that will have two pages: Home and Profile
2. Using the Rick & Morty APIâ€™s Character endpoint (https://rickandmortyapi.com/), create a
table on the Home page with the following columns: Avatar, Name, Species, Status.
Generate data in the table based on the received response.
3. When the user clicks on one of the names, navigate to the Profile page that will show info
about the character. Data should come from the API endpoint.
4. The character profile page should have a Back button that will navigate back to the main
table.
5. Use pagination in the main table.
6. Create an input field on the Home page to search among character names. It should have
an onChange event, and you should only show rows that contain the searched string.
